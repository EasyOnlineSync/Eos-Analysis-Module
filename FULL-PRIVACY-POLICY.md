# Privacy Policy – Eos Analysis Module

The Eos Analysis Module was developed to provide full transparency and security to the user. The extension does not collect, store, or share personal data.

## Data Processed
Only technical information required for functionality is processed: URL, title, and video/file data. These data are **intercepted and redirected** exclusively to the Easy Online Sync software, for the sole purpose of performing the local download.

This information is not retained by the extension, not shared with third parties, and not used for any purpose other than executing the requested download.

## What Is Not Collected
- No browsing history is stored.  
- No account information (login, password, cookies, session data) is accessed.  
- No personal data (name, email, documents, contacts) is collected or transmitted.  

## How Interception Works
When the user attempts to download a supported file (e.g., .exe, .zip, .apk, .iso), the extension intercepts the browser’s download and automatically redirects it to Easy Online Sync.

This process occurs **only through explicit user action**, such as clicking “Download” or accessing a link. The browser does not complete the download on its own; the file is handled by the Eos software.

## Site Integrations
Plugins for sites (YouTube, Anitube, AnimesOnlineCC, XVideos, AnRoll, etc.) work only to capture media links and send them to Eos. No additional data about the user or their accounts on these sites is collected.

## Transparency and Control
The user can enable or disable each plugin or file type in the extension’s settings. All actions are visible and configurable by the user, with no hidden processes.
